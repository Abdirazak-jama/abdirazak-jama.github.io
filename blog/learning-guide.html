<section id="long-term-goal">
    <h3 class="centered-heading">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>My long-term goal is to start my own digital marketing agency. I’m inspired by my older brother, who has had a successful career in this field, and I aim to follow in his footsteps. My passion for digital marketing and my desire to create innovative solutions drive me toward this goal. To achieve this, I plan to gain hands-on experience in digital marketing through internships and entry-level roles, further my education with relevant courses and certifications, and build a strong professional network. Currently, I’m focused on</p>

<section id="strengths-limitations">
    <h3 class="centered-heading">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
    <p>I am highly motivated to explore new topics and ideas, driven by a deep curiosity and eagerness to learn. I thrive when faced with challenges that require problem-solving, and I enjoy pushing myself to find solutions. However, I sometimes spend too much time analyzing information, which can slow down my learning process. I also tend to get frustrated when I don’t grasp something immediately, which can impact my motivation. Additionally, my perfectionism often leads me to delay progress as I try to perfect every detail instead of moving forward. Despite these challenges, my drive to learn and challenge myself remains strong, and I continue to work on improving my approach.</p>

<section id="skills-development">
    <h3 class="centered-heading">What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>While at Dev Academy, I would like to develop stronger communication and collaboration skills. Being able to clearly express ideas and work effectively with others is key in any environment, especially in tech, where teamwork is essential. I also aim to build resilience and adaptability—learning how to navigate setbacks and pivot quickly when challenges arise. Additionally, I want to strengthen my time management and prioritization abilities, so I can maintain a balance between thoroughness and efficiency, avoiding perfectionism that might slow down my progress. Cultivating these skills will help me grow both as a professional and an individual.</p>

<section id="workload-management">
    <h3 class="centered-heading">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
    <p>In this programme, I am committed to managing my workload by staying organized and maintaining open communication with my peers and Facilitators. To ensure productivity, I will create a clear daily and weekly schedule, setting realistic goals and breaking down tasks into manageable pieces. I’ll prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance to stay on track without feeling overwhelmed. When working with others, I will maintain a respectful and collaborative approach by actively listening, offering help when needed, and staying open to feedback. I believe that clear and frequent communication is essential for a positive and productive learning environment. If I start to feel overwhelmed or things begin to build up, I will take a step back to reassess my priorities. I’ll break larger tasks into smaller, more achievable steps, and if necessary, seek guidance from Facilitators or peers to gain perspective. Additionally, I’ll make time for self-care to recharge, whether it’s through taking breaks, practicing mindfulness, or getting outside. This will allow me to manage stress and stay focused on my long-term goals while remaining productive and healthy.</p>

<section id="seeking-help">
    <h3 class="centered-heading">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
    <p>I am committed to proactively seeking help when I encounter challenges or roadblocks. If I don’t understand a concept or task, I will first take time to research independently and explore available resources, such as course materials or online tutorials. However, I recognize the importance of not getting stuck for too long, so if I’m still unsure after a reasonable effort, I will reach out for help promptly. I plan to use the following steps to seek assistance:
    <ul>
        <li>Peers: I will first consult with fellow learners to get different perspectives and collaborate on solutions.</li>
        <li>Facilitators: If further clarification is needed, I will reach out to Facilitators through designated channels.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

<section id="facilitation-expectations">
    <h3 class="centered-heading">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>From the Facilitation team, I expect clear and consistent communication, particularly around key deadlines, expectations, and feedback. I value timely responses to questions or concerns, as this helps me stay on track and make adjustments when necessary. I also hope for supportive guidance that encourages both independent problem-solving and collaboration within the learning community. Additionally, I want the Facilitators to be patient with me as I work through challenges, knowing that I may need extra time to fully grasp certain concepts. Having patience and understanding will help me feel more confident and supported throughout the programme.</p>

<section id="scheduling-information">
    <h3 class="centered-heading">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
    <p>I have some personal commitments that I need to balance alongside my studies. One of my main responsibilities is translating for my aunty and uncle when they have important things they need to attend. They mostly rely on me to handle many tasks until they get used to living in this country and settle down. Because of this, I may occasionally have times blocked out to support them, but I will manage my schedule to ensure I stay on top of my workload.</p>
